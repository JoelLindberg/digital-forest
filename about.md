## {{ page.subtitle }}

I'm a system administrator/developer. This is my professional home playground.

I feel really good about building things, whether it be new things or improving on or around something existing.

### Background

I am mostly a self taught coder (since ~2018), except for a couple of university courses (PHP and Python). My formal education is within Networks and Systems as well as Digital Visualization. Most of my professional career has been spent within infrastructure and IT services.

My general approach is usually not to stay in a small scope for a longer period of time. Like many others I try to balance moving fast and doing things right. I like broad strokes and to use existing battle tested technology as much as possible.

One important criteria for a technology to be adapted is that it should be openly documented. I decided to follow the *openly documented* philosophy for my own experiments as much as possible. This is one of the reasons why I created this blog.
