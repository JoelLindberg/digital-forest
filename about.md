# About

## {{ page.subtitle }}

I'm a developer and a system administrator. This is my professional playground.

I feel really good about building things, whether it be new things or improving upon or around something that already exists.

<br />

### Background

I am mostly a self taught coder (since ~2018), except for a couple of university courses (PHP and Python). My formal education is within Networks and Systems as well as Digital Visualization. Most of my professional career has been spent within IT infrastructure which means I am relatively new in the programming world.

My general approach is to usually not stay in a small scope for a long period of time. I find it the most rewarding, and also common sense from a production point of view, to try to re-use as much technology as possible that already exists to serve my purpose. Therefore I tend to embrace technologies that allow me to move fast, but should preferably be well-known, openly documented and secure as well. However, as moving fast is important, it is equally important to know the key underlying parts of the technology used, and therefore it is great to always have a personal project on the side that allows for just that purpose.
