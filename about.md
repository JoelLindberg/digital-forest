# About

## {{ page.subtitle }}

I'm a developer and IT professional with a broad IT background.

I am mostly a self taught coder (since ~2018), except for a couple of university courses (PHP and Python). My formal education is within Network and Systems and Digital Visualization. Most of my professional career has been spent within IT infrastructure which means I am still relatively new in the programming world (compared to my general IT experience).

I dig a little bit deeper when required but generally don't stay in a small scope for a long period of time. I find it the most rewarding, and also common sense from a production point of view, to try to re-use as much technology as possible that already exists to serve my purpose. Therefore I tend to embrace technologies that allow me to move fast. However as moving fast is important it is equally important to know the key underlying parts of the technology used, and therefore it is great to always have a personal project on the side that allows for just that.

I feel really good about building things, whether it be new things or improving something that already exists and is in production.
